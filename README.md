 Perceptron & Adaline
In this lab, we will guide you through the implementation of Perceptron and Adaline, two of the first machine learning algorithms for the classification problem. We will also discuss how to train these models using the optimization techniques.

 Regression
This lab guides you through the linear and polynomial regression using the Housing dataset. We will also extend the Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to solve the regression problem.
